# Git cherry-pick

## First, start with the official documentation at [git-cherry-pick](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick)

## Then, use the markdown styling from Atlassian's Cherry-pick page at: [Atlassian's Cherry-pick page](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/cherry-pick)

### What I like about the above link is that it shows the command line . Also, I like the block style characters and background font-color contrast that are used to show the command line

## Finally, what I want is an guide that provides detail to a level that it is helpful and also a pleasent experience to read. I want to be able to read the guide and understand the concepts and be able to use the command line

### I want to use the basic cherry-pick definition and then provide a few examples of how to use it. I want to show the command line. I want to show the block style characters that are used to show the command line

### I would love to be able to create documentation like the Why the Lucky Stiff. Nice article here: [What we can learn from “_why”, the long lost open source developer](https://github.com/readme/featured/why-the-lucky-stiff) page
